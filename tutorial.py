'''Tutorial 2

 Commands in COMP-9 are typed with the following
 structure:
  name <argument 1>  <argument 2>, ...
 Arguments are pieces of data that the command uses
 to execute it's function. For example, the "echo"
 command takes one argument, which is text. It then
 displays that text.

'''Tutorial 3

 Try it out! Type the command below into the console:
  echo Hello, world!
 You should see the words "Hello, world!" displayed on
 the screen. You now know how to call commands! Type
 "help" for all of the commands. Add "-h" as the first
 argument of any command to get specific help about
 that command.
