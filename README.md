# comp9
Comp9 (only capitalized at the start of a sentence) is a hacking/programming game currently in development by *miko1112*, also known by his [itch.io username, *graffiti*](https://miko1112.itch.io/). It is currently in it's early stages, but is designed to be as moddable as possible. Comp9's *command line itself* is built in *comp9's scripting language*. In the future, comp9 will have NPC computers, a questline and a story to follow through. Or you could just mess around doing random stuff. _Or_ you could create your own quests and stories.

This repository stores three things:
 - The Python source code of the game's engine
 - The C9S (Comp9Script) source code of the default command line firmware
 - The default config file

If you are simply downloading the game, *do not download the C9S source code.* The game automatically installs it on boot.
